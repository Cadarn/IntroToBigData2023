# Archival content

Previous versions of this course have been delivered with overlapping content and different implementations of some of the technology. The original version of the content material was developed by [Paul Freemantle (2016-2017) and Julie Weeds (2019-2020)](https://github.com/julieweeds/BigData).

The practical workshop exercises from that course are replicated here as potential extension materials. And are in the `original-labs` folder; please refer back to the original repo for any additional content surrounding technology requirements. To follow these assignments in parallel with the 2023 workshop may require the student to adapt to our chosen deployment of technology. The required data may be in the root `data` folder although this cannot be guaranteed.
